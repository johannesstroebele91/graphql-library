# Basics

The GraphQL Server

- defines and exposes the GraphQL API
- (e.g. movies and the relation b/w directors and movies)
- so that the cleint application
- can request data from it

So client application (e.g. React) can request

- data from a database (e.g. MongoDB)
- indirectly through a GraphQL server
