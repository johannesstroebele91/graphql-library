# Basics

1. Create the query (like with GraphiQL before)
2. Take that query and bind it to a component (to have access to the returned data)
3. Enable frontend to be able to communicate with the GraphQL server (By default it is not accepting requests)

# Example

- Requests: MovieList.js
- Mutations: AddMovie.js
